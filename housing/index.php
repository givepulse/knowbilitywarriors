		AHA!’s homes are integrated into neighborhoods around Austin. Our first two homes were
		received from and are dedicated to the memory of two ardent disability rights activists,
		Carol Eisenberg and James “J.T.” Templeton. Carol spent her life advocating for
		independence and access; after she died, her family wanted to ensure that the accessibility
		modifications she had made would continue to benefit other people with disabilities. AHA!
		purchased her home with City of Austin affordable housing bond funding. J.T., one of AHA!’s
		founding members,  fought his way out of state institutions where he had been forced to live
		for thirty years and, along with his wife Karen, eventually bought and built a fully
		accessible home through the Texas Home of Your Own program. Upon his death he gave his home
		to AHA! so that other people with disabilities could live in a home that was accessible,
		affordable and integrated into a neighborhood.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		AHA! believes that we all deserve to live in homes that are not only safe and decent but that
		allow us to exercise our rights to independence and dignity, that we can afford, and that
		allow our children and us to participate in our neighborhoods. For AHA!, the good home is
		supported by three pillars: Accessibility, Affordability, and Integration.
	</p>

	<h3>Accessibility = Dignity and Independence</h3>
	<h4>Our houses include the following features that allow our tenants to live comfortably and independently in their own homes:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Ramps</li>
		<li>Wide doorways</li>
		<li>Levered door handles</li>
		<li>Hardwood, tiled or laminate flooring</li>
		<li>Roll-under sinks</li>
		<li>Lowered counter-tops</li>
		<li>Smoke detectors for people with hearing and visual impairments</li>
		<li>Roll-in showers where possible</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Affordability = Security and Stability</h3>
	<p>
		Our tenants are people with disabilities who would otherwise be priced out of the current
		housing market or forced to live in institutions. Our housing alleviates the negative
		effects of poverty and removes uncertainty; our tenants pay rent that is commensurate with
		their incomes, and AHA! accepts Section Eight vouchers. We also strive to reduce the
		burden of utility costs by making our houses energy efficient.
	</p>

	<h3>Integration = Participation in Community</h3>
	<p>
		AHA!’s scattered-site model allows our tenants be part of a neighborhood. Living in higher
		opportunity neighborhoods, they have access to shopping and public transportation; adults
		are close to community college and children are close to good schools. Our tenants actively
		participate in the life of the community: their children make friends with other children
		and their families enjoy neighborhood block parties.
