	<p>
		With a 73% unemployment rate, people with disabilities are overrepresented in Austinâ€™s
		low-income population. The fair market rent for a 2-bedroom apartment in Austin is
		$1,050; yet the average person with a disability receives less than $700 per month in
		Social Security. This has resulted in a shortage of 6,000 homes for low-income households
		that include a person with disabilities. As housing prices rise, it is increasingly
		difficult to find homes that are affordable, accessible, and integrated into safe,
		transit-oriented, and amenity-rich neighborhoods.
	</p>

	<p>
		Accessible Housing Austin! was founded in 2005 by disability rights advocates who
		recognized that the scarcity of housing was a critical issue for people with disabilities.
		AHA! is the only housing non-profit in Austin led by members of the disability community
		whose mission is to provide affordable, accessible, integrated housing for low-income
		people with disabilities.

	<p>
		We serve a diverse range of Austinites with disabilities, including adults and children
		with mobility impairments, visual impairment, chronic illness, and other physical and
		emotional disabilities.
