2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,500
My name is Linda Sands. I was born in 1967

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,500
Along with my twin sister Kathy.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,500
We both have severe disabilities of cerebral palsy.

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,000
(music playing)

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,439
(music playing)

7
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,200
When our mother became ill,

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,070
she had to have surgery and other things take place;

9
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:41,200
and when she is your main caregiver, and she is down

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,809
it kind of put all three of us in a nursing
home.

11
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:48,000
When you've been independent, and parents raise you

12
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,000
promising you would never be in a nursing home,

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and you end up in one, it kind of lowers your
self-esteem somewhat.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,690
You're living under somebody else's

15
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,940
regimen and rules, and how they run things,

16
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,000
and what's available to you and what's not.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Kathy and I just turned forty a week after it happened,

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,300
and that was hardly a wonderful way to celebrate your fortieth birthday.

19
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:31,300
(music playing)

20
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,200
It's our first place in quite a while, and

21
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,000
the roll-in shower gives us a sense

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
of independence and freedom

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,640
and peace of mind knowing that we can function

24
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,360
in this house freely.

25
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,800
Disabled people are just like
anyone else.

26
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,200
We feel. We have the same joys,

27
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,300
same desires, same hopes

28
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,000
and we go through the challenges

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
of everyday life as well,

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,500
along with our disability.

31
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:09,000
(music playing)

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Housing is a basic implement in life.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
and if people can't afford it,

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,060
they're missing one of their fundamental rights

35
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,640
I believe.

36
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:25,280
Without those opportunities for everyone,
how can we truly be free?

37
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,000
And let everyone have a chance at happiness

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,100
and contentment and a feeling of belonging

39
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,660
in their community.

40
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:41,660
When the disabled are happy, it can help only
make the rest of us happy.

41
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:46,800
