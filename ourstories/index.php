	<p>
		James worked in the commercial and residential construction business until he had a stroke in 2011 which caused paralysis in his legs . While he was recovering in rehab, he was unable to pay his mortgage, and he lost his house to foreclosure. He was able to move into a home that had been rehabilitated for accessibility by AHA!. He says, “The house is in a good location for me and I’d like to stay as long as possible. I am able to go grocery shopping with my kids using the bus…The elementary school that my son goes to is just up the street.”
