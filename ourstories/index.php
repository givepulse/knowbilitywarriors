Elainna and her son are very happy in their new home and neighborhood. Elainna feels safe letting her son play outdoors. Her son loves his teachers and is doing much better at his new school.

                James worked in the commercial and residential construction business until he had a stroke in 2011 which caused paralysis in his legs . While he was recovering in rehab, he was unable to pay his mortgage, and he lost his house to foreclosure. He was able to move into a home that had been rehabilitated for accessibility by AHA!. He says, “The house is in a good location for me and I’d like to stay as long as possible. I am able to go grocery shopping with my kids using the bus…The elementary school that my son goes to is just up the street.”
