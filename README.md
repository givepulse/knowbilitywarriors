The **Accessibility Internet Rally** is a community hackathon with a unique twist â€“ accessibility! Open-AIR increases awareness of the tools and techniques that make the Internet accessible to everyone - including people with disabilities. AIR benefits nonprofit organizations and schools in your community by providing them with free, professionally designed, accessible websites.

In the spirit of Open-Air, a few techies from around the world came together to help an Austin nonprofit. We decided to hack an accessible website for Accessible Housing Austin: Accessible, Affordable, and Integrated Housing for People with Disabilities in Austin, Texas.
