            With a <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:110%;">73% unemployment rate</span>, people with disabilities are over represented in Austin’s
            low-income population. The fair market rent for a 2-bedroom apartment in Austin is
            <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:110%;">$1,050</span>; yet the average person with a disability receives less than <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:110%;">$700 per month</span> in
            Social Security. This has resulted in a <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:110%;">shortage of 6,000 homes</span> for low-income households
            that include a person with disabilities. </p>

                As housing prices rise, it is increasingly
            difficult to find homes that are affordable, accessible, and integrated into safe,
            transit-oriented, and amenity-rich neighborhoods.

            Accessible Housing Austin! was founded in 2005 by disability rights advocates who
            recognized that the scarcity of housing was a critical issue for people with disabilities.
            <strong>AHA! is the only housing non-profit in Austin led by members of the disability community
            whose mission is to provide affordable, accessible, integrated housing for low-income
            people with disabilities.</strong>
